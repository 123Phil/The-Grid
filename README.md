Lights out game written for command line


One of the first programs I wrote just for kicks.

If you've played Lights out this should be familiar. When you press a square, it flips the surrounding squares...
The objective is to turn all of the lights off.
So here I implemented a randomizer that ensures the board is solveable...

I also included a secret menu that can show the steps needed for solving.
It uses a simple solve algorithm, and a screener to reduce the steps required.

Cool Stuff!
